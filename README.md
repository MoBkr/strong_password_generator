# 🔐 Password Generator

## 🚀 Overview
Welcome to the **Password Generator** project! This Python-based script is designed to create strong, random passwords with a user-specified length. The password generated will be a secure combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## ✨ Features
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that the password length is greater than 5 characters, with user-friendly error handling.
- **Balanced Composition**:
  - 60% letters (30% uppercase, 30% lowercase)
  - 20% digits
  - 20% special characters
- **Randomized Output**: Utilizes Python's `random` module to shuffle characters, ensuring each password is unique and secure.

## 🛠️ How to Use
Follow these simple steps to generate your own secure password:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-generator.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd password-generator
   ```

3. **Run the Script**
   ```bash
   python password_generator.py
   ```

4. **Enter Password Length**
   - When prompted, input the desired password length (must be more than 5 characters).

5. **Get Your Password**
   - The script will generate and display a strong, random password based on the length you specified.

## 🧩 Example
```bash
What Is Your Password Length?
8
Your Password Is : 8@QzTpY!
```

## ⚙️ Requirements
- **Python 3.x**

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
We have some exciting features planned for future releases:
- **Customizable Character Distribution**: Allow users to set their own percentages for uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- **Exclusion Options**: Provide options to exclude specific characters, like ambiguous ones (`l`, `1`, `O`, `0`).
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Implement a user-friendly interface for non-technical users.
